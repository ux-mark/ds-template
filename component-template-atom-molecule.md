# [Component Name]
<!-- Directions are contained within square brackects.
 Example for reference in comments is a Button component.
 Both directions and examples should be removed in component documentation file -->

## Purpose
[ What does this do for the user?
How can the user interact with it? ]
<!--  A button provides an affordance for the user to undertake an action. It can be a call to action or a subtle hint as to what the user can do next. -->
 
## Accessibility 
[ How is this component accessible? What has been considered? ]
<!-- The color of a button adheres to a color text color contrast ratio that is higher than 4.5:1. -->

## Usage
[ There may be one or many scenarios when this component is valid. ]
<!-- Buttons can be used in situations where the user will want to: 
 - Submit a form
 - Commence a new action
 - Stop an action -->
 
### How to use it
[ Describe how the component should be used, ]
<!-- Be intentional in the use of a button as it provides a clear message to the user that something will be achieved or canceled with the button click. Use buttons sparingly as they are prominent interactable elements for the user that will cause noise if overused.  -->

### How is it different
[ Describe how the atom/molecule is different to others that ux designers, engineers and product managers may confuse it with. ]
<!-- A button is different to a link as it:
- Stands alone outside of text and tables
- Offers a greater affordance, whether visually or for screen readers
- Will do something on the page, which is an important reason for screen readers as <a > will navigate elsewhere whereas  <button > can interact on this page -->
 
## Example usage
[Where is this used in other molecules / organisms?]
[ Where is this used in our products? ] 
<!-- Buttons are ubiquitous throughout the product. They appear in modals, forms, actions etc. -->

## Variants
[Details on the different variants that can be used and how these map to props/knobs/controls that can be used by engineering, ensuring UX styling is entirely contained within the component.]

### [Variant 1] Primary
#### When to use
[Detail the points when this is the best component to use for the user]

#### How to use
[Provide information as to the means in which this component is best used]
<!-- Use it in a prominent space that will confirm to the user that this is the main course of action they should take. -->
